						 In 2006, the International Fashion Trend Research Center announced that "fast and fashionable" will become the development trend of the clothing industry in the next ten years. Fast fashion has four main characteristics, including the rapid provision of popular styles and elements, low prices, large models, and small quantities, to stimulate consumer interest and maximize consumer demand. It can be said that fast fashion is a product of the four social trends of globalization, democratization, youth and the Internet.

					        		The rise of fast fashion and social media have affected the whole fashion industry. This fast product launching pace of fast fashion focus only on "quantity" but "quality". The sacrifice of creativity alone with the most importantly "spiritual value" has made fashion something superficial, losing its soul and its unique feature. The key reason for the fast product changing pace in fast fashion is that the manufacturer of these trendy clothes is usually not the original creator of the trend but just the copier. Although in recent years, the case of plagiarism from famous brands has always been reported, the news seems still barely affects it. Far from raising the awareness of plagiarism to the society, fast fashion brands even profit more than the original creators. If this kind of situation is not improving, the creator will surely decrease. Though, fast fashion even customers would become the killer of creativity.

					        		The manufacturing process inevitably costs natural resources and leads to unnecessary wastes.For instance, to plant a sufficient amount of Cotton for one jean can cost up to 8506 liter of water, which is enough for a person to shower 122 times. However, this is just a little part of the wast. Afterward, the coloring process would cost up to 640 thousand kilometers of fabric and 3.15 million liters of water, which is quite astonishing. Nowadays in counties like China, India, and so on, where cotton and clothes majorly come from, have faced the problem of lacking water. It is estimated that in 2030 the need for water would increase by 50%, which could even lead to a lack of drinking water.
					        		<br><br>
									 In addition to the huge amount of water consumption, the electricity required for clothing production is also not ignorable. The weaving process of one-tonne cotton fabric would take up to 6.5 thousand kilowatts. The normal usage of electricity for one person per month is 350 kilowatt a month, which means an hour of the process would provide the usage for 1800 families.

					        		The true essence of fast fashion is not fast "fashion" but fast "replacement". Customers do not purchase out of "needs" but "temptation ". According to statistics, in the US there are up to 12.80 million tonnes of clothing dispositions which ends up in landfills. These clothing dispositions not only cause considerable amounts of carbon pollution but is also difficult to be decomposed, which lead to the pollutions of soil and underground water, causing nonnegligible environmental damage. 
					                Even if these fast fashion clothes were abandoned in the recycling box, most of them still end up in landfills instead of sending them to those in need on account of the low quality and durability of these clothes.

					        		The secret behind the low price of fast fashion is the sacrifice of labor rights. 
					        		<br><br>
									On April 24th, 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka Bangladesh fell, and 1134 people were killed in it. These victims were mostly females and child laborers who worked for these low payment clothing factories.

				Slow fashion is the idea of making fashion sustainable. The word "slow" in this phrase doesn't literally refer to the pace of speed. Instead, it is about the focus on clothing quality, durability, and all-match features comparing with "fast" fashion, which is usually produced massively and has a seasonal marketing strategy.
				<br><br>
				In addition to using renewable and eco-friendly ingredients for production, slow fashion clothes are usually produced in an ethical way. Practicing fair trade while having no exploitation of laborers nor mass production, slow fashion showed the unique value of garments itself. Moreover, slow fashion clothes feature basic and simple designs that will never fall out of trend and could let you shine on your own style while being eco-friendly at the same time.

				The core of slow fashion is a combination of sustainable fashion and ethical fashion. With our passion for fashion, we surely have no reason to let our eco-system and laborers fall into the victims of fashion trends.
				<br><br>
				Slow fashion makes sustainable fashion more than just an idea, but the true practice from clothing production to marketing till the moment you put it on.
				<br><br>
				With the focus of high-quality clothes, the true meaning behind the phrase "slow fashion" are the ways to make fair trade, eco-production, and sustainable development all come true.
				<br><br>
				Therefore, please "slow" down with us. Feel the true beauty of clothes while making an effort for the environment.

					Stop over purchasing clothes! Here are the questions you need to consider before making a purchase. Do I really need it? Do I have similar ones? Will I constantly wear it? Just think before you leap! Don't fall into the devil of impulse, and find that the clothes you bought just end up lying at the bottom of your wardrobes without wearing even once.<br><br>
					Quality>quantity <br>
					Instead of buying cheap, low quality, high disposable rate clothes, we recommend more expensive but high quality and well-designed ones. In a long-term perspective, it not only saves unnecessary waste but also lessens environmental burdens for disposing of clothes.

						 五個來自交通大學傳播與科技學系的大二生，熱愛時尚也關心環保。一開始我們只是純粹煩惱衣櫃總是爆滿，但是卻常常不知道該穿什麼的問題，希望可以藉由二手衣物買賣，延續衣物本身價值。在苦惱的同時，我們逐漸開始反思，究竟為什麼人人都會有衣櫃爆滿的困擾？如果所有人的衣櫃都已經爆滿，那還需要大量製造衣物嗎？而不斷製造與丟棄衣服的過程中，我們又造成了多大的浪費？有沒有辦法改善這個問題，且不限於個人，而是改善整體社會共同的困擾？
						 <br><br>
						思考解決辦法與搜尋資料之際，我們發現了人類每年的廢棄衣物造成了多大的時尚浪費，對於環境又是多大得負擔。更因此發現了「慢時尚」這個理念，在時尚與永續之間，我們看到了取得平衡的可能。
						<br><br>
						因此！我們致力於瞭解每件衣服背後的生產故事，相信「慢時尚」不僅僅是購買衣物時的一種選擇，更可以是一種生活方式，是一種人人都該有的時尚態度！
						<br><br>
						透過推廣「慢時尚」，我們想帶給人們更好的衣物及生活品質，同時也為環境省下不必要的浪費。藉由理念的傳遞，讓「慢時尚」成為改變世界的力量！
						<br><br>
						所以請你慢下來，與我們一起重新感受衣服最純粹的美好！
